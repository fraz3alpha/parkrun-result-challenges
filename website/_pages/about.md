Running Challenges is a way to have fun with your weekly parkrun results, whether you run, jog, walk, or volunteer.

See how much of a parkrun 'obsessive' you are, see how close you are to being an Alphabeteer, whether you've made it into the Compass Club, and just how close you are to a full house in Stopwatch Bingo!

Collect badges and stars when you volunteer in different roles - are you a three-star marshal yet? Check in on your friends' progress by visiting their profiles too.

Running Challenges is an extension for the Google Chrome web browser. It is created and maintained with love by keen parkrunners, [Andy](https://twitter.com/fraz3alpha) and [Laura](https://twitter.com/lauracowen). We just wanted to share the fun with other parkrunners around the world, regardless of whether you volunteer, run, walk, or jog, at your home parkrun or elsewhere.

# Ethos

We want everyone to have a bit of fun with this, and hopefully it encourages a few
more people to get out on a Saturday (or Sunday for Juniors) to progress towards
getting a new badge. We passionately believe that parkrun is not just about running -
it is also about the community spirit, and volunteering for the good of everyone,
which is why it was very important to us to get the volunteer badges available as
soon as possible. We will continue to try and do a few little extra things to ensure the
focus is not about running every week, and that those who give back to parkrun are appropriately
rewarded.
