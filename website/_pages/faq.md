**How do I get Running Challenges in my life?**
Head over to the Chrome Web Store and install our free [Running Challenges extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/running-challenges/kdapmdimgdebpgolimjnmcdlkbkddoif) now!

**How does Running Challenges work?**
Running Challenges looks at your results on the parkrun website and works out how you're doing in a set of challenges. For each completed challenge or volunteer role, it displays a badge on your page.

**Do I need to log in to Running Challenges?**
Nope! After installing the Running Challenges extension in your Chrome web browser, just visit your (or anyone else's!) parkrun results page to see all your lovely badges. Click the shortcut icon in the top-right of the browser window to go directly to your parkrun results page.

**Can I install Running Challenges on my phone or tablet?**
No, sadly, Chrome browser extensions only work on desktop or laptop computers.

**Can I use Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox web browsers?**
Running Challenges is currently available only for the Chrome web browser. If you normally use a different web browser, you'll need to install Chrome on your computer.

**Why does Chrome Web Store say it can "Read and change your data on www.parkrun.ca" when I'm not in Canada?**
The Running Challenges extension works on several parkrun country websites, not just Canada (`.ca`). The Chrome Web Store just chooses (for some reason!) to display one of the web addresses. If you want to know what the Running Challenges extension does with your data, read on...

**What does the Running Challenges extension do with my data?**
When you visit your parkrun results page, Running Challenges looks at your results and adds your badges and progress tables to the top of the page. 
All your data is kept on the parkrun website and in your web browser (much the same way as it is when you visit the webpage without the extension - it's just more fun this way!).
