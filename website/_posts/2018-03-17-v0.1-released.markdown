Welcome to version 0.1 of the Running Challenges Chrome Extension!

This extension is the result of a week's worth of development by [Andy Taylor](https://twitter.com/fraz3alpha)
 & [Laura Cowen](https://twitter.com/lauracowen). We saw how much fun people were
 having on the [UK parkrun Tourists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/571983126241545)
 Facebook Group and thought that the games people played with their results were
 great, but very manual to work out. There seemed to be a proliferation of
 individual Excel spreadsheets and various other ways of tracking, and it was
 screaming out for some technical wizardry!

The extension works with the information available on your athlete results history
page on the parkrun website to work out which challenges you have completed and
display the appropriate set of badges at the top of the page, and the challenge
progress in a table at the bottom of the page:
