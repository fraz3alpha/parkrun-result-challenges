It's Christmas!

Well, it's Christmas soon, and to celebrate, we have released a new running
badge to adorn those runners who have managed to run on Christmas day.

(We'd really like to give extra special kudos to those volunteers giving up their
Christmas morning, but until the parkrun website lists the dates of each volunteer
role, unfortunately we aren't able to do so.)


Additionally, we have added the 'All Weather Runner' badge, contributed by
[Russell Boyatt](https://github.com/rboyatt) - this badge celebrates those parkrunners
who have kept up their attendence come rain or shime and have run at least once
in every calendar month (they don't have to be in the same year).

Happy parkrunning!

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon - typically we
have found it takes a few days for Chrome and Firefox to auto-update, but it should
do so eventually. If you haven't yet joined the fun you can get it from one of
the links below. :
