Now with the Car Park Marshal badge!

This is the latest of a number of small updates, including:

- Addition of the "Tourism Streak" stat
- Addition of a map link to the average parkrun location stat
- Reorganisation of the Regionnaire section to make it more compact
- Updating (possibly completing!) the volunteer role translations
- Addition of the Car Park Marshal volunteer role badge

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon, if not you can get it
from one of the links below:
