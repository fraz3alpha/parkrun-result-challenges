We have released version 0.3 which includes flags, the missing volunteer badges,
and initial support for the remaining parkrun websites

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon, if not you can get it
from the [Chrome WebStore]({{ site.data.webstore.webstore-running-challenges-link }}) today!
